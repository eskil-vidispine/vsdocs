The media management area contains functions essential for searching, managing, and enhancing projects. The media management area also displays the currently selected tab, or the default window for opening/creating projects. Each tab offers a dedicated space for a specific function. Each designed to support the editing process, tabs and their functions range from project search and creation, to adjustments in the timeline.
