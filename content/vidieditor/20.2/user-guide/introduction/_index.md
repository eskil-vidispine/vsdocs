VidiEditor provides journalistic and creative users with a fast and versatile, browser-based editing solution to face the challenges of a modern and dynamic editing environment. As an HTML5 application, VidiEditor offers editors accessibility, and can be used wherever a stable internet connection is available. When paired together with a full Vidispine integration, users can enjoy a more streamlined editing workflow: from searching and importing assets and collections, as well as exporting sequences.
