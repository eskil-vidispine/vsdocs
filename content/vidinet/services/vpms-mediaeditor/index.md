MediaEditor is a browser based proxy editing solution for journalists and video
content producers who need to quickly and easily create short- and medium-form
content. The entry feature set enables easy proxy editing, for example in news,
web, sports or infotainment, with capabilities to render high quality content
that is air-ready for broadcast or as web content. MediaEditor is fully
integrated for use with Vidispine Starter and Team Edition.
