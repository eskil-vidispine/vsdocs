There is still a gap between man and machine. The computer needs to use an interpreter layer, a graphical user interface, to be able to communicate with a human. This type of communication is a slow process compared to a computer or a system of computers that can process any number of instructions received or sent very fast in-between. 

We wanted to build a high-performance MAM solution with flexibility and integration capabilities not limited by any existing human user interfaces. So, we decided to start from the computer's point of view and build an API driven architecture.  

The result - our core product VidiCore - is a MAM solution and a developer interface allowing you to specify multiple generic and configurable metadata models in the same repository, capturing all information you need on any object in the database.â€¯
